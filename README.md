# NC-Cancer-Instances

Cancer instance data from [NC State Center for Health Statistics](https://schs.dph.ncdhhs.gov/data/cancer.cfm). 

In February, the World Health Organization published a sobering forecast: “Over 35 million new cancer cases are predicted in 2050, a 77% increase from the estimated 20 million in 2022.” The WHO’s estimate comes amidst a flurry of news reports about an increase in the number of young people diagnosed with cancer. In March, The New York Times reported that “millennials born around 1990 now have twice the risk of colon cancer compared with people born around the 1950s, while millennials’ risk for rectal cancer is about four times higher than that of older age groups, according to a study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.”

Researchers have identified associations between certain activities, lifestyles and diets — such as smoking, eating red meat and consuming processed foods — with cancer risk. But these factors alone might not explain the full picture, per a recent quote by a National University of Singapore hepatologist: “Many have hypothesized that things like obesity and alcohol consumption might explain some of our findings — but it looks like you need a deeper dive into the data.” (Nature)

Our paper centers on another conceivable suspect for higher cancer instance rates in younger populations: deteriorating environmental conditions. The prevalence of microplastics in the environment has been studied as a potential “driver” for the early onset of colorectal cancer; so too have different air pollutants and water pollutants. The threat of climate change compounds these concerns.

Specifically, our group aims to predict cancer instance rates in each North Carolina county based on that county’s environmental quality indicators. We seek to understand which compounds and environmental variables play the greatest role in determining cancer instance rates in the state, and which environmental subdomains most influence counties’ cancer instance rate projections. The answers to these questions may hold significant practical applications because they can offer stakeholders actionable insights, guide policy decisions, steer resource allocation and shape public health initiatives.

Question 1: Is there a specific domain within the EQI (Environmental Quality Index) dataset that exhibits a higher propensity for predicting cancer incidence rates?

Question 2: What are the most reliable indicators for identifying counties with the highest incidence rates of cancer? Conversely, what factors are indicative of counties with the lowest rates of cancer?
